</div>

Given a dataset containing items and users (what items the user has liked), we use Weighted Matrix Factorisation to build a Recommender System that can suggest new documents to a user using both *Content-based filtering* and *Collaborative filtering*.

The system accepts as an input *a user* (i.e., a set of liked documents), and returns a ranking of documents the user might like.

## Usage

The [RecommenderSystem Jupyter notebook](./RecommenderSystem.ipynb) contains all the information to build a custom Recommender System, and provides an example of Movies RS (data is taken from the files inside the [data](./data/) folder).
