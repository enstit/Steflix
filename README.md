</div>

**Steflix** is a Recommender System that uses Weighted Matrix Factorisation to learn embeddings from movies ratings, and uses *Content-based filtering* and *Collaborative filtering* to suggest new (ranked) movies to a the user.

The Weighted Matrix Factorisation step is performed using the Alternating Least Squares algorithm[^1].


## Usage

The [RecommenderSystem Jupyter notebook](./RecommenderSystem.ipynb) contains all the information to build a custom Recommender System, and provides an example of Movies RS (data is taken from the files inside the [data](./data/) folder).
