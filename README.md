</div>

Given a dataset, containing items and users (what items the user has liked), we built a Weighted Matrix Factorization to find the user and item embedding.

The system accept as input *a user* (i.e., a set of liked documents), and return a ranking of documents.

## Usage

The [RecommenderSystem Jupyter notebook](./RecommenderSystem.ipynb) contains all the information to build a custom Recommender System, and provides an example of Movies RS (data is taken from the files inside the [data](./data/) folder).
