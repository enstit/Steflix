# Recommender System

Given a dataset, containing items and users (what items the user has liked), build a Weighted MF to find the user and item embedding.

The system must accept as input "a user" (a set of liked documents), and return a ranking of documents (you can use the fact that you have a vector representation for document to provide the ranking).
